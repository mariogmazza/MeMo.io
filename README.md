## The Memory Game based on the classic Simon Game from the 80's

## About This Site 

Technologies used Node/Express/React/PassportJS/MongoDB/Mongoose and some other NPM packages.

### The Idea behind it
Build a website that brings in people for the classic game of "Simon", 
if user registers the scores will be saved to allow the user to measure his/her 
performance. When a register user logs in more "memory" games will be available to them.
